This project analyzes publicly available data from the DKASC solar research center in Alice Springs. 
It compares three systems: a fixed panel from 2008 (BP), a solar tracker from 2008 (Kyocera), and a fixed panel from 2016 (Tindo). 
The goal is to quantify the impact of the technology versus the tracking systems.

Methodology
Data: Obtained from DKASC (Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre), with daily frequency throughout 2025.
Cleaning: Processed in R to unify formats and remove duplicates.
Normalization: All values ​​are expressed in kWh/kWp (energy generated per kW of installed panel), allowing for fair comparison between systems of different capacities.
Visualization: Interactive dashboards created in Tableau Public.

Dashboards and Key Findings

Dashboard 1: Overview
Annual Totals: Tindo (2016) leads with 2,076.9 kWh/kWp, followed by Kyocera (1,828.5) and BP (1,499.9).
Monthly Generation: Clear seasonal pattern with peaks in summer (December-February).
Dominance Heatmap: Tindo dominates all 12 months of the year (green), Kyocera never wins a month.

Dashboard 2: Comparative Advantages
Tracker Advantage (Kyocera vs. BP): The tracker generates between +4 and +9 kWh/kWp more each month. The advantage is greater in summer.
Modern vs. Tracker (Tindo vs. Kyocera): The modern panel outperforms the older tracker in most months. Annual advantage: +13.7%.

Dashboard 3: Stability and Consistency
Monthly distribution: Tindo (green) is the most stable and productive. Kyocera (orange) shows high variability (greater risk). BP (blue) is stable but obsolete.


Conclusions
Technology improves faster than tracking: A modern fixed panel outperforms an older tracker by 13.7%.
Trackers offer an advantage: 22% better than fixed panels of the same era.
Technological evolution: 38.7% improvement in 8 years (Tindo vs. BP).
Recommendation: Invest in modern panels first. Add trackers only if the panels are current and the budget allows.
